# Ball-Shaprio-s-Ascension
This is a game that I made in Pygame for my Intro to Computer Science class in grade 10. To play it, download the zip file, then if the folder is not named "Golf Tower" rename it to that name, and then run the exe inside the folder.

The game is a 2D platformer heavily inspired by the games 'Getting Over it with Bennet Foddy' and 'Jump King'

The button to enter pause mode is 'p' and the button to exit it is 'o'.
