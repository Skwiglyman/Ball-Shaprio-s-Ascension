# Ball-Shaprio-s-Ascension
This is a game that I made in pygame for my ICS final project in grade 10. To play it, download the zip file, then if the folder is not named "Golf Tower" rename it to that name, and then run the exe inside the folder.

The button to enter pause mode is 'p' and the button to exit it is 'o'.
